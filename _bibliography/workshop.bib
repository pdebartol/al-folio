     abstract={Several works have shown that state-of-the-art classifiers are vulnerable to adversarial examples, raising serious concerns for their deployment in safety-critical applications. To address this issue two classes of methods have emerged: empirical defences and certified defences. While the former has good robustness, but no guarantees, the latter sacrifices some robustness in exchange for guarantees. Until now, these two approaches have not been systematically compared in the literature, and a clear understanding of the robustness gap remains elusive. In this paper, we show through extensive empirical evidence that models trained with certified defences suffer from worse accuracy, robustness and fairness than empirical defences. Further, we identify three key factors contributing to the robustness gap between the two approaches and support our arguments with both theoretical and experimental evidence. We hope this serves as a guide to practitioners regarding the use of various defences as well as a motivation for designing future methods.}

      abstract={Recently, Aubin et al. (2021) proposed a set of
linear low-dimensional problems to precisely evaluate different types of out-of-distribution generalization. In this paper, we show that one of these
problems can already be solved by established
algorithms, simply by better hyper-parameter tuning. We then propose an enhanced version of
the linear unit-tests. To the best of our hyperparameter search and within the set of algorithms
evaluated, AND-mask is the best performing algorithm on this new suite of tests. Our findings
on synthetic data are further reinforced by experiments on an image classification task where we
introduce spurious correlations.},
