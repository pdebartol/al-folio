      abstract={Recently, Aubin et al. (2021) proposed a set of
linear low-dimensional problems to precisely evaluate different types of out-of-distribution generalization. In this paper, we show that one of these
problems can already be solved by established
algorithms, simply by better hyper-parameter tuning. We then propose an enhanced version of
the linear unit-tests. To the best of our hyperparameter search and within the set of algorithms
evaluated, AND-mask is the best performing algorithm on this new suite of tests. Our findings
on synthetic data are further reinforced by experiments on an image classification task where we
introduce spurious correlations.},
