     abstract={Randomized trials are considered the gold standard for making informed decisions in medicine, yet they often lack generalizability to the patient populations in clinical practice.  Observational studies, on the other hand, cover a broader patient population but are prone to various biases. Thus, before using an observational study for decision-making, it is crucial to \emph{benchmark} its treatment effect estimates against those derived from a randomized trial. We propose a novel strategy to benchmark observational studies beyond the average treatment effect. First, we design a statistical test for the null hypothesis that the treatment effects, conditioned on a subset of relevant features, differ up to some tolerance value. Then, we estimate an asymptotically valid lower bound on the maximum bias strength for any subgroup in the observational study.  We validate our lower bound in a real-world setting and show that it leads to conclusions that align with established medical knowledge.}
