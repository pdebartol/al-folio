     abstract={In the era of fast-paced precision medicine, observational studies play a major role in properly evaluating new drugs in clinical practice. Yet, unobserved confounding can significantly compromise causal conclusions from observational data. We propose a novel strategy to quantify unobserved confounding by leveraging randomized trials. First, we design a statistical test to detect unobserved confounding with strength above a given threshold. Then, we use the test to estimate an asymptotically valid lower bound on the unobserved confounding strength. We evaluate the power and validity of our statistical test on several synthetic and semi-synthetic datasets. Further, we show how our lower bound can correctly identify the absence and presence of unobserved confounding in a real-world setting.}

      abstract={Accurate predictions of environmental controls on ecosystem photosynthesis are essential for 
      understanding the impacts of climate change and extreme events on the carbon cycle and the provisioning of 
      ecosystem services. Using time-series measurements of ecosystem fluxes paired with measurements of meteorological variables from a 
      network of globally distributed sites and remotely sensed vegetation indices, we train a recurrent deep neural network 
      (Long-Short-Term Memory, LSTM), a simple deep neural network (DNN), and a mechanistic, theory-based photosynthesis model with 
      the aim to predict ecosystem gross primary production (GPP). We test these models' ability to spatially and temporally
       generalise across a wide range of environmental conditions. Both neural network models outperform the theory-based model 
       considering leave-site-out cross-validation (LSOCV). The LSTM model performs best and achieves a mean R2 of 0.78 across sites 
       in the LSOCV and an average R2 of 0.82 across relatively moist temperate and boreal sites. This suggests that recurrent deep neural networks provide a basis for robust data-driven ecosystem photosynthesis modelling in respective biomes. However, limits to global model upscaling are identified using cross-validation by vegetation types and by continents. In particular, our model performance is weakest at relatively arid sites where unknown vegetation exposure to water limitation limits model reliability.},
