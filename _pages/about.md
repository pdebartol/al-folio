I am a PhD student in the Computer Science Department at ETH Zürich, advised by <a href="https://sml.inf.ethz.ch/group/fannyy/"> Fanny Yang</a>. Next Fall, I will be visiting the <a href="https://causalab.sph.harvard.edu/"> CAUSALab</a> at Harvard University.

I earned a Data Science M.Sc. at ETH Zürich, with a strong focus on statistics and machine learning. Prior to that, I earned a Computer Science B.Sc. at Politecnico di Milano and I spent an exchange semester at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.

My research centers on developing theoretically grounded machine learning methods for two primary goals: discovering new drugs and evaluating their effectiveness once released in the real world. Recently, my focus has been on the latter objective, specifically exploring approaches to integrate multiple data sources for treatment effect estimation in the presence of hidden confounding and other potential sources of bias.


I search for great food in my free time. <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dLAPyMRM7EseTCzUJxRHxg5cH28zorRAejlY0h7wbR8/edit?usp=sharing"> Here</a> you can find a list of my favorite restaurants around the world.
