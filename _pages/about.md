I am a PhD student in the Computer Science Department at ETH Zürich, advised by <a href="https://sml.inf.ethz.ch/group/fannyy/"> Fanny Yang</a> and <a href="https://people.math.ethz.ch/~jopeters/"> Jonas Peters</a>. I earned a Data Science M.Sc. at ETH Zürich, with a strong focus on statistics and machine learning. Prior to that, I earned a Computer Science B.Sc. at Politecnico di Milano and I spent an exchange semester at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.

Broadly speaking, my research aims to develop (theoretically grounded) machine learning methods for two main purposes: discovering new drugs and evaluating their effectiveness once released in the real-world.


I search for great food in my free time. <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dLAPyMRM7EseTCzUJxRHxg5cH28zorRAejlY0h7wbR8/edit?usp=sharing"> Here</a> you can find a list of my favorite restaurants around the world.
