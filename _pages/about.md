I am an incoming Ph.D. student in the Computer Science Department at ETH Zürich, advised by <a href="https://sml.inf.ethz.ch/group/fannyy/"> Fanny Yang</a> and part of the <a href="https://sml.inf.ethz.ch/">Statistical Machine Learning</a> group. 

 I earned a Data Science M.Sc. at ETH Zürich, with a strong focus on statistics and machine learning. Prior to that, I earned a Computer Science B.Sc. at Politecnico di Milano and I spent an exchange semester at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.

Currently, I am particularly interested in developing robust and fair methods to tackle complex problems in health care.

 I am also a member of <a href="https://leadthefuture.tech/"> LeadTheFuture</a>, a leading mentorship non-profit organization for students in STEM.
