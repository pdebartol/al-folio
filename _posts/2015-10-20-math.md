This theme supports rendering beautiful math in inline and display modes using [MathJax 3](https://www.mathjax.org/) engine. You just need to surround your math expression with `$$`, like `$$ E = mc^2 $$`. If you leave it inside a paragraph, it will produce an inline expression, just like $$ E = mc^2 $$.

To use display mode, again surround your expression with `$$` and place it as a separate paragraph. Here is an example:

$$
\sum_{k=1}^\infty |\langle x, e_k \rangle|^2 \leq \|x\|^2
$$

You can also use `\begin{equation}...\end{equation}` instead of `$$` for display mode math.
MathJax will automatically number equations:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:cauchy-schwarz}
\left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k b_k \right)^2 \leq \left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k^2 \right) \left( \sum_{k=1}^n b_k^2 \right)
\end{equation}

and by adding `\label{...}` inside the equation environment, we can now refer to the equation using `\eqref`.

Note that MathJax 3 is [a major re-write of MathJax](https://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/upgrading/whats-new-3.0.html) that brought a significant improvement to the loading and rendering speed, which is now [on par with KaTeX](http://www.intmath.com/cg5/katex-mathjax-comparison.php).

We present an authentic Tiramisù recipe in~\Cref{alg:two}. This might even be considered as a contribution of the thesis, as it strives to mitigate the reproducibility crisis of good Italian desserts. Enjoy the Tiramisù.

\begin{algorithm*}
\caption{Tiramisù}\label{alg:two}
\kwIng{\\ceramic baking pan\;
electric mixer \;
350gr mascarpone \;
120gr sugar \;
60g egg yolk \;
90g egg white \;
30g cocoa powder \;
400ml espresso coffee\;
200gr savoiardi\;}
\vspace{2mm}
\KwResult{1 baking pan of Tiramisù (16x22cm)}
\vspace{2mm}
\kwRec{\\Prepare 400ml of good espresso and let it cool down in a container \;
Separate the egg whites and yolks into two separate bowls \;
\While{whites cream is not white and stiff}{
	Whip the egg whites \;
	Gradually add 60 gr of sugar \;
}
Add 60gr of sugar into the yolks bowl \;
\While{yolks cream is not yellow and smooth}{
 Whip the egg yolks \;
}
Put 350gr of mascarpone into a new bowl \;
\While{mascarpone is not smooth and creamy}{
Gently whip the mascarpone \;
}
Add the yolks cream into the mascarpone bowl\;
\While{mascarpone-yolks cream is not smooth and uniformly mixed}{
Whip mascarpone and yolks\;
(Bonus) Add some Baileys for the "Tiramisù ubriaco" version\;}
Add some whites cream into the mascarpone-yolks bowl\;
\While{mascarpone-yolks-whites cream is not smooth and uniformly mixed}{
Gently mix with a wooden spoon with bottom-up movements\;
Gradually add more whites cream\;}


\While{baking pan is not full}{
Dip the savoiardi in coffee and arrange them to cover the surface of the baking pan\;
Gently spread the cream on the savoiardi until they are fully covered --  be generous here\;
Sprinkle with cocoa powder q.b.\;
